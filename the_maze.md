# The Maze GDD

## What is The Maze?
The maze is a non linear narritive puzzle game.

## Moment to Moment Gameplay
- Navigate rooms
- Talk to NPCs 
- Give/Recieve Items 
- Enter boot codes

## Solution concepts
### Songboots
- Use your songboots to enter unique movement based codes. This is the primary puzzle solving method

#### Codes have unique effects:
- Sending you to a specific or relative room (send to room 10, or to 5 rooms past where you currently are) either immedetly or make stairs that send you there

- Giving you items, or making items appear somewhere in the Maze

- There are also Special codes that can only be entered at certain rooms: like a code that lets you enter a number in binary

### Information from NPCs
- talk to things (people, chests, cows and bees?) and figure out what to do based on that



## puzzle concepts 
- missing rooms (you go from 22 to 24 and you're like oh where 23?)
- backtracking to solve in another room
- giving items to NPCs (you unlock shit from other rooms and give it to other NPCs)
