The idea here is for the player to be immersed in the concept that The Maze is this surreal place people can enter.
The OutsideWorld has 3 goals that all aid each other

1. Draw contrast from reality and The Maze
2. Immerse the player in understanding the nature of the Maze
3. Immerse the player in understanding their character outside the Maze?

1. Draw contrast from reality and The Maze
To establish the Maze is this surreal extra-ordinary place, I think players could understand what's ordinary.
OutsideWorld Vs Maze
-Players move freely vs on a grid.
-There's nothing interesting vs you can do wild nonsensical things
-The enviroment is static vs a shifting rage world

2. Immerse the player in understanding the Maze
At the moment

3. Immerse the player in understanding the character?
This is iffy because characters still need to be understood alongside the Maze but how do these characters enter 
this Maze?
Are they part of some experiment? Is this from their homes?
