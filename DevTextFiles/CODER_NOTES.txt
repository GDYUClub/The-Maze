ROADMAP:
	Make the Maze a playable single player experience
	Make the Maze look pretty
	Make the Maze have cool thematic things
	Make the level editing work
	Make the multiplayer work

Next: (Crtl+Shift+F "###" to find things that need to be worked on)
	Look at Godot top down shooter tutorial to see how walls are done
	Rework customization settings from Fragile bounds
	Grab my file reading code. MAKE SURE I CLOSE MY FILES!! FOR SAFETY!! In TestSpace:
		I need to have a way to throw errors somehow like what if someone makes there be 26 rooms
		maybe a tile can have multiple things, like a transfer function and something that looks like an exit
		Figure out Transfer functions
	Make the Maze movement read:
		Rooms - To make walls and circuits work
		Circuits
	Ok my file legend should also have "Observers" that the can activate circuits
	Add basic art
	Add some juicy sounds
