# The Maze GDD

## What is The Maze?
The maze is a non linear 2d Grid-based narrative puzzle game.
Connect disparate information and piece together not only the secrets of this maze but also a way to escape.

## Moment to Moment Gameplay
- The game is based in screen sized rooms. Go to stairs to travel to another room, the Rooms eventually loop around on themselves. (or maybe getting back to the top requires a movement code?)
- Talk to NPCs in the rooms to learn important information
- Give/Receive Items to/from NPCs and other things in the environment, Players will have a simple inventory with one item equipable at a time.
- Solve puzzles
- Enter boot codes, your movements are recorded, certain movement patterns do things.

## Puzzle solving tools
### Songboots
- Use your Songboots to enter unique movement based codes. Most puzzles will be solved by you figuring out the correct movement code needed
- You can move in 4 cardinal directions, each direction playing a note moving twice in the same direction will play a different note, 8 notes in total, one octave.

#### Code effects:
- Sending you to a specific or relative room (send to room 10, or to 5 rooms past where you currently are) either immediately or make stairs that send you there
- Giving you items, or making items appear somewhere in the Maze
- Codes that can only be entered at certain rooms: like a code that lets you enter a number in binary only when used in a certain room

### Information from NPCs
- Talk to things (people, chests, cows and bees?) and figure out what to do based on that
- Items can be received from NPCs

#### NPC item types:
- Items that you can give to other NPCs to advance a quest-line
- Items that are temporary or only exist for a limited time (cow's milk that goes bad after a certain number of "mooooves")
- Items that are able to be placed in certain areas (finding a statue and putting a jewel inside it)


## Puzzle Ideas we came up with:
- The Maze floors skip over a room (goes from 22 to 24, skipping 23). You need to discover a method of navigation other then going down stairs to be able to travel there.
- Songboot codes delivered though song, with the notes the NPC sings being notes you can play with certain movements
- A logic puzzle with 3 chests, all of them making some accusation about the others lying. Decern which one is telling the truth and open that one
    - maybe opening the wrong chests sends you to a random floor?
- Using Items that are findable after the relevant NPC appears, requiring you to wrap around and give it to them
- Chests that are connected? so putting an item inside one will let you retrieve it from another (could be a solution to the milk spoiling idea)
- an NPC who seems to know more then they're letting on sharing secrets about how to navigate the maze (what is their deal)

## Lore, Story, and Context
### Questions that need to be answered:
- The Maze itself: who what where when why how
- Why did the game release 40 years later after it was left unfinished?
- who is the player, what is their goal
- who are the NPCs, what are their goals
- why boots, why sounds
- The golden piece, How should the game end?
