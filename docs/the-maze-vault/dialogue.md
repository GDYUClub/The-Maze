### Cows (each point is a separate cow)
- The maze really is cool! Its so relaxing here. I spent my entire life mazing!!
- I think BEES are creepy, they fly around and eat their own vomit. *you should talk to bees*
- Why are there cows and bees in the maze? I don't know. I don't even know why I am a COW.
- Did you know that cows can produce MILK? MILK is tasty, but it can spoil pretty fast. *It spoils faster than you might assume*
- Yoooo whats up? are you mazing right now? What? You want my MILK?

### Bees
* Why does everyone call this place the maze? Aren't mazes made out of hedges?
* CHESTS are pretty friendly, if you see a CHEST you should try talking to them. *You have no choice but to converse with them*
* Hey buddy, im craving some MILK right now. Its pretty difficult for a BEE like me to go get milk. You look like you know how to get some, can you pleae deliver some MILK to me? Ill make it worth your while. 
* (same bee as previous, post milk) Yooooo this MILK is so MILKY. Here, have my HONEY as reward. *Well done.*
