### Cows (each point is a separate cow)
-The maze really is cool! Its so relaxing here. I spent my entire life mazing!!
-I think bees are creepy, they fly around and eat their own vomit. *you should talk to bees*
-Why are there cows and bees in the maze? I don't know. I don't even know why I am a cow.
-Did you know that cows can produce MILK? MILK is tasty, but it can spoil pretty fast. *It spoils faster than you might assume*
-Yoooo whats up? are you mazing right now??
