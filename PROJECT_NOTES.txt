A top down 2d turn based? Maybe multiplayer game about players who seek to maneuver around and hunt each other to 
keep control of the golden piece that controls the maze they’re stuck in. Every player is constantly tracked by the 
changing Maze and is thirsty to learn what footsteps activate the secrets of the Maze and avoid leaving fatal traces 
for others. The Grand Architects of the Maze search for those cunning enough with the golden piece and are… 
always.. hungry.

	Bounties/"Questions that need to be solved" section to be figured out
	Handy Resource database would be neat
