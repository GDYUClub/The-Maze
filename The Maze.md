## puzzle ideas
Every code is unique
combo puzzle (3 or 4 inputs)
missing rooms (you go from 22 to 24 and you're like oh where 23?)
backtracking to solve in another room
giving items to NPCs (you unlock shit from other rooms and give it to other NPCs)
rooms in jumbled order (1 -> 7 -> 12 -> 3)
#### binary type code

## To Do
## Game
What type of sounds do we want? 8 notes on a scale from a particular sound can be an instrument
How de we translate to the player what the sounds do? Chests tell you? should be done in first room?
How many rooms in total? 6 rooms excluding tutorial room
## Enemies
Cows (Chests hate them cause they moo and smell)
Bees (Chests are scared of them cause they sting)
Chests won't talk to you unless you defeat them
## Rooms
Every room has a chest no matter what
### Tutorial Room
How the song boots work?
### Room 1
1 cow?
### Room 2
1 bee?
### Room 3
1 cow 1 bee?
### Room 4
1 cow 2 bees?
### Room 5 
lying chests?
### Room 6 (extra room)
you fell for the lying chest
your reward: 2 cows 3 bees
### Spells
stun: stuns enemies
buff: gives you more movement
talk to chest: you talk to chest
## Lore
### All chests have song boots
They see you already have them on so they talk to you
### Why are the chests talking?
Because the developer played souls dark and there was a message with "friend ahead" prompt in front of a mimic and thought that she wanted to be friends with the mimics
### The boots overheat you gonna take em off

### Why song boots?
The golden piece will give you a way but an unconventional way
